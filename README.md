# TicTacToe-Pic18f45k22-Lpc1768
Tic-tac-toe game using microchip and controller.
tic-tac-toe game using pic18f45fk22 to operate the game logic and Mbed lpc1768 as a remote control to play the game. 18 LED’s are operated using nine I/O pins of pic-microcontroller using multiplexing scheme. Serial Communication is established between microchip and microcontroller.Instructions from remote control(lpc1768) are collected on pic18f45fk22, checksum of received instruction is calculated, upon successfully validation required information is parsed executed and updated on GUI in real time. 
Hardware & Software: PIC18f45k22, LPC1768, Breadboard, LED’s, MAX232, Pickit, MP Lab, Tera-Term and C-programming.
